## 2. Grant of License

Subject to your compliance with all terms of this Agreement, the Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, revocable, non-transferable (except as provided in Section 10), royalty-bearing license to:

a. Use, reproduce, modify, and create Modifications and Derived Engines from the Engine for any purpose, including commercial purposes.  
b. Distribute, sell, license, or otherwise make available binaries or source code of the Engine, Modifications, or Derived Engines, whether privately or publicly, in open source or closed source form.  
c. Use the Engine, Modifications, or Derived Engines to develop, distribute, sell, or monetize Products.  
d. Fork the Engine and maintain private or public repositories of Modifications or Derived Engines.  

This license extends to both source code and binary distributions. You may sublicense the Engine, Modifications, or Derived Engines to third parties only under the exact terms of this Agreement, and any such sublicensees shall be bound by all obligations herein, including but not limited to royalty payments and Splash Screen requirements. You are responsible for ensuring compliance by your sublicensees.

## 3. Attribution Requirements

If you engage in Open Source Distribution of Modifications or a Derived Engine, you must include a prominent notice in the source code, documentation, and any distributed materials crediting the original Cryonic Engine. The notice must state:

This software is based on or incorporates portions of the Cryonic Engine, developed by Cryonic Engine. All rights reserved. For more information, visit [https://cryonicengine.com](https://cryonicengine.com).

Failure to include this attribution constitutes a material breach of this Agreement. No attribution is required for closed-source (binary-only) distributions or private use.

---

## 4. Splash Screen Requirement

**Every Product developed using the Engine, a Derived Engine, or any part thereof must display the Splash Screen prominently at startup or launch for a minimum duration of two (2) seconds, without modification, obstruction, or removal.**  

This requirement applies regardless of whether the Product uses the original Engine, a fork, Modifications, or a Derived Engine, and irrespective of the extent of changes made.  

You may remove the Splash Screen only if you have purchased and maintain an active plan from the Licensor that explicitly allows removal of the Splash Screen from Products. Removal Plans are non-transferable and must be renewed as specified by the Licensor. Unauthorized removal of the Splash Screen constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

## 5. Royalties and Fees

a. **Royalty Obligation:** For each Product that uses the Engine, a Derived Engine, or any portion thereof, you agree to pay the Licensor a royalty of four percent (4%) of all Revenue exceeding Two Hundred Fifty Thousand United States Dollars (US $250,000) per Product, measured over the Product’s lifetime.  

The $250,000 threshold applies once per Product. Royalties are owed **only** on Revenue earned beyond this threshold, regardless of whether the Product uses the original Engine, a fork, Modifications, a Derived Engine, or any software that incorporates any portion of the Engine’s code or functionality.

b. **Scope:** The royalty applies to any Product, commercial or otherwise, that directly or indirectly incorporates the Engine or a Derived Engine, whether modified or unmodified. There are no exemptions for internal, educational, or non-commercial uses once Revenue is generated. Royalties may only be waived through a written agreement signed by the Licensor.

c. **Reporting and Payment:** You must maintain accurate records of all Revenue for at least five (5) years.  

Once a Product’s lifetime Revenue exceeds US $250,000, you must:

1. Notify the Licensor within thirty (30) days of crossing the threshold.  
2. Submit quarterly reports thereafter, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, detailing Revenue figures, Product name(s), and royalty calculations.  
3. Pay the royalty within sixty (60) days of the quarter’s end via wire transfer or another method approved by the Licensor.  

Late payments accrue interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law.

d. **Audit Rights:** The Licensor may audit your Revenue records with reasonable notice, at the Licensor’s expense, unless discrepancies exceeding five percent (5%) are discovered, in which case you bear all associated costs. You must cooperate fully with any audit.

e. All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars (USD). You are responsible for all applicable taxes, duties, or fees related to royalties, excluding taxes on the Licensor’s net income.

f. **Failure to Pay:** Failure to timely report or pay royalties constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may result in termination under Section 8.

## 6. Restrictions

You may not:

a. Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices in the Engine.  
b. Use the Engine or Derived Engines in any way that violates applicable laws, including export controls.  
c. Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Engine except to the extent permitted by law.  
d. Claim ownership of the Engine or represent that a Derived Engine is not subject to this Agreement.  
e. Attempt to circumvent royalty obligations, Splash Screen requirements, or any other terms through technical means, restructuring, or otherwise. Any software that includes, derives from, or is based on the Engine remains subject to this Agreement in perpetuity.

## 7. Ownership and Intellectual Property

The Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in the Engine, including all intellectual property rights. You own your Modifications, but grant the Licensor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your Modifications if you engage in Open Source Distribution. Trademarks associated with "Cryonic Engine" remain the property of the Licensor and may not be used without prior written consent, except as required for attribution.

## 8. Termination

This Agreement terminates automatically if you breach any term. Upon termination:

a. All licenses granted hereunder cease immediately. You must immediately discontinue sales, downloads, and monetization of all Products developed with the Engine or any Derived Engine, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Licensor.  
b. If you continue to sell, distribute, or otherwise profit from any Product that incorporates the Engine or a Derived Engine after termination, you remain fully liable for all royalties that would have been owed under this Agreement, and such continued use will constitute willful infringement.  
c. You must destroy all copies of the Engine, Modifications, and Derived Engines in your possession.  
d. You must pay any outstanding royalties within thirty (30) days of termination.  

Licensor may terminate this Agreement only for material breach by Licensee or for legal necessity. Sections 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 survive termination.  

e. The Licensor may pursue all legal remedies, including

injunctions, damages, and recovery of legal fees.
